# Spotify-Playlist

This is just an script that allows you to create a playlist in spotify with the artist you want and with the numbers of songs you want to have in the playlist.

The most important thing is to have an CLIENT_ID AND CLIENT_SECRET to run this script, you can get that information in Spotify for developers website.

For redirect_uri variable for better results for local development on a local server you should use "http://localhost:8888/callback", this will allow you to run 
the program without any problem.
